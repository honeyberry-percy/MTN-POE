The App to work on is a crop catalyst app and it is going to use the MEAN stack. It is composed of MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js, all of which support JavaScript for developing complex, high-performance and reliable apps. MEAN components all speak JSON, ensuring uninterrupted data flow between layers since one language is used for client-side and server-side development (JavaScript). 

The crop catalyst app will be an online market place for local fresh produce where the customer can purchase directly from the producer (farmer). The targeted users are local small scale farmers, South African Farmers Association, Investors, department of agriculture etc.
